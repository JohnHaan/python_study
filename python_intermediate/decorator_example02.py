#output:now you are inside the hi() function
#       now you are in the greet() function
#       now you are in the welcome() function
#       now you are back in the hi() function

# This shows that whenever you call hi(), greet() and welcome()
# are also called. However the greet() and welcome() functions
# are not available outside the hi() function e.g:

greet()
#outputs: NameError: name 'greet' is not defined
